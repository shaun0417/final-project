i downloaded the assets i need for my game. 
right now my code has these functions:
1. move cat by left/right keys
2. score up when cat and colored fish collide
3. game ends instanly when cat collides with the grey fish

12.11
brief summary of the game:
1. game main screen -> blue/green fish stage -> catnips -> yellow/purple fish stage
2. game clear screen appears when the hunger gage is full
3. cat grows bigger as it eats fish
4. catnips reset the hitbox&size of the cat, and gives 20 point each
5. When cat eats catnip it becomes high and gets a little faster
6. collide with grey fish->reset score/positions
